					Assignment 7

5.) Create a program that functions as a simple boolean calculator for 32-bit integers. It should display a menu that asks the user to make a selection for the following list:
1.x AND y
2. x OR y
3. NOT x
4. x XOR y
5. Exit program

ExitProcess PROTO
WriteString PROTO
ReadString PROTO
Crlf PROTO
Str_compare PROTO
XYAND PROTO
XYOR PROTO
NOTX PROTO
XXORY PROTOX

.code
main proc
	mov rdx, OFFSET Firstmenu
	call WriteString
	call Crlf 
	mov rdx, OFFSET Secondmenu
	call WriteString
	call Crlf 

	mov rdx, OFFSET Thirdmenu
	call WriteString
	call Crlf 
	mov rdx, OFFSET Fourthmenu
	call WriteString
	call Crlf 

	mov rdx, OFFSET Fifthmenu
	call WriteString
	call Crlf 
	mov rdx, OFFSET choice
	mov rcx, 2
	call ReadString

	mov rbx, OFFSET caseTable
	mov rcx, numberOfEntries
	moved r8, BYTE PTR [choice]

	L1:
		movzx r9, BYTE PTR [rbx]
		cmp r8, r9
		jne L2
		call NEAR PTR [rbx + 1]
		call WriteString
		call Crlf
		jmp L3

	L2:
		add rbx, entrySize
		loop L1

	L3:
		call ExitProcess

	mov ecx, 0
	call ExitProcess
main endp

Process_1 PROC
	mov rdx, OFFSET msg1
	call WriteString
	ret
Process_1 ENDP

Process_2 PROC
	mov rdx, OFFSET msg2
	call WriteString
	ret
Process_2 ENDP

Process_3 PROC
	mov rdx, OFFSET msg3
	call WriteString
	ret
Process_3 ENDP

Process_4 PROC
	mov rdx, OFFSET msg4
	call WriteString
	ret
Process_4 ENDP

Process_5 PROC
	mov rdx, OFFSET msg5
	call WriteString
	ret
Process_5 ENDP
endp


6.) Continue the solution program from Exercise 5 by implementing the following procedures:

*And_op: Prompt the user for two hexadecimal integers. AND them together and display the result in hexadecimal.

*OR_op: Prompt the user for two hexadecimal integers. OR them together and display the result in hexadecimal.

*NOT_op: Prompt the user for a hexadecimal integer. NOT the integer and display the result in hexadecimal.

*XOR_op: Prompt the user for two hexadecimal integers. Exclusive-OR them together and display the result in hexadecimal.
(The Irvine32 library is required for this solution program.)
